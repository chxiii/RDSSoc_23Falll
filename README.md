## Assignment Content

These assignments includ these contents:

* Assignment1_Chenxi.pdf
  
A 1,200-word critical reflection, including short bibliography, on the scientific methodologies introduced during the first part of the module. You should identify what you are interested in researching and how, and also your beliefs about how the world “works” (i.e. ontology), and how we can generate useful knowledge about it (i.e. epistemology). In doing this, you should reflect critically on the different approaches you have been introduced to in the module, identifying which you believe are most suited to your beliefs/interests, which less so, and why.

* Assignment2_Chenxi.pdf
  
A 1,200-word research outline, including short bibliography, in which you develop a research question, position it within an academic literature, and identify how your question will contribute to that literature. As part of this assignment you will be required to provide feedback (around 200 words) on a classmate’s outline.

* Assignment3_Chenxi.pdf

Design an appropriate plan of research to answer a research question. You should aim here to apply the approach you identified in the first assignment in a consistent and justified way to the research question you identified in the second assignment. The project should be in the form of a 2,500-word max.
